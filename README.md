###Lab Unit Testing

Import the code into your favorite IDE. In NetBeans, make sure 
you import it as a "Java project from existing sources".

#####Exercise 1.
Examine the code in src/main and the tests for 
LinearStructureArray in src/test. What are the drawbacks to 
this way of testing? Write down your answer.

#####Exercise 2.
Rewrite LinearStructureArrayTest. Use JUnit and Hamcrest and 
try to apply the best practices explained in the slides. Take note 
of the postconditions stated in LinearStructure (the interface) 
to improve your tests.

#####Exercise 3.
Write an analysis of the testability of LinearStructureArray. How 
could it be rewritten to improve the testability? What problems did 
you encounter in exercise 2?
